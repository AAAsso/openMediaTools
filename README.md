# Goal
The Goal of this project is to search for link, reference and sources in medias article to give help people analyse what they are reading.

It should have a similar interface to the "Decodex" application from Le Monde. But the main difference is that instead
of having journalist ranking media, it will focus on estimating transparently information quality by searching for context.
